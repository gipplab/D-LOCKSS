clusterMgr --> crdt : manages
clusterMgr --> pinTracker : starts (LocalPinTracker per shard)
clusterMgr --> clusterStore : persists state

crdt --> pubsub : syncs state (dlockss-shard-<id>)
crdt --> dht : routing (DHT adapter)
pinTracker --> crdt : reads state
pinTracker --> ipfsClient : pins content

fileOps --> storage : pins/unpins (via mgr)
fileOps --> shardMgr : checks responsibility

shardMgr --> rateLimit : Check(peer) before processing messages

storageMonitor --> dataDir : monitors disk usage (optional)

discovery --> mdns : uses
discovery --> host : connects peers

host --> dht : provides routing
host --> pubsub : provides messaging

dht --> ipfsNet : queries providers
pubsub --> peers : broadcasts messages
mdns --> peers : discovers locally

watcher --> dataDir : monitors

subMgr --> pubsub : subscribes to all shard topics
subMgr --> dashboard : feeds node/shard state
subMgr --> repTracker : tracks manifest replication
geoIP --> geoDB : local lookup (preferred)
geoIP --> geoAPI : batch API fallback (if no local DB)
geoIP --> dashboard : region display
