Custodial --> Delegated: DELEGATE message sent
Delegated --> HandoffComplete: Replication >= MinReplication
HandoffComplete --> [*]: unpinFile()

Responsible --> Monitoring: Replication in range\n[MinReplication, MaxReplication]
Monitoring --> UnderReplicated: count < MinReplication
Monitoring --> OverReplicated: count > MaxReplication
Monitoring --> Removed: count > MaxReplication + 3

UnderReplicated --> Monitoring: Replication restored
OverReplicated --> Monitoring: Replication reduced

Responsible --> Removed: File no longer tracked
Removed --> [*]
